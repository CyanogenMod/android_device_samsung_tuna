/**
 * @defgroup MLDMP
 * @brief
 *
 *  These are the top level functions that define how to load the MPL.  In order
 *  to use most of the features, the DMP must be loaded with some code.  The
 *  loading procedure takes place when calling inv_dmp_open with a given DMP set
 *  function, after having open the serial communication with the device via
 *  inv_serial_start().
 *  The DMP set function will load the DMP memory and enable a certain
 *  set of features.
 *
 *  First select a DMP version from one of the released DMP sets.
 *  These could be:
 *  - DMP default to load and use the default DMP code featuring pedometer,
 *    gestures, and orientation.  Use inv_dmp_open().
 *  - DMP pedometer stand-alone to load and use the standalone pedometer
 *    implementation. Use inv_open_low_power_pedometer().
 *  <!-- - DMP EIS ... Use inv_eis_open_dmp(). -->
 *
 *  After inv_dmp_openXXX any number of appropriate initialization and configuration
 *  routines can be called. Each one of these routines will return an error code
 *  and will check to make sure that it is compatible with the the DMP version
 *  selected during the call to inv_dmp_open.
 *
 *  Once the configuration is complete, make a call to inv_dmp_start(). This will
 *  finally turn on the DMP and run the code previously loaded.
 *
 *  While the DMP is running, all data fetching, polling or other functions can
 *  be called and will return valid data. Some parameteres can be changed while
 *  the DMP is runing, while others cannot.  Therefore it is important to always
 *  check the return code of each function.  Check the error code list in mltypes
 *  to know what each returned error corresponds to.
 *
 *  When no more motion processing is required, the library can be shut down and
 *  the DMP turned off.  We can do that by calling inv_dmp_close().  Note that
 *  inv_dmp_close() will not close the serial communication automatically, which will
 *  remain open an active, in case another module needs to be loaded instead.
 *  If the intention is shutting down the MPL as well, an explicit call to
 *  inv_serial_stop() following inv_dmp_close() has to be made.
 *
 *  The MPL additionally implements a basic state machine, whose purpose is to
 *  give feedback to the user on whether he is following all the required
 *  initialization steps.  If an anomalous transition is detected, the user will
 *  be warned by a terminal message with the format:
 *
 *  <tt>"Error : illegal state transition from STATE_1 to STATE_3"</tt>
